In the Student table, the marks column contains a list of values separated by commas. How can you determine the number of values in this comma-separated list?
Exception : u cant just add count(marks) because if u want to count marks in row so u need length based approach for this
Table query : CREATE TABLE Student (
	id INT NOT NULL,
	name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	marks VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
INSERT INTO Student (id, name, marks)
VALUES (1, 'Rohit', '87,92,76,89');

Soln: Select id,name,length(marks) - length(REPLACE(marks,',',"))+1 AS num_marks
From student
where id=1;
